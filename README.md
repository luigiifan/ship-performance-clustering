## Introduction
This project analyzes ship performance data (fuel, speed, engine load) to optimize efficiency. After preprocessing and EDA, K-Means clustering groups ships by performance, evaluated with Silhouette Score and visualized via UMAP. A Random Forest model classifies performance, assessed by accuracy and F1 score, to improve efficiency and reduce fuel.
